# Service Canada Interactive Mapping Application ([SCIMA](https://ktjaco.github.io/scima/))
## Points of Service (PoS) as of November 2017

**SCIMA** is an interactive web map application developed with [Mapbox JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.1.1/) to assist with the visualization of Service Canada Points of Service at a national level. Canada is home to over 200 Scheduled Outreach and 300 permanent Service Canada Centres, plus additionial Passport Canada and Part-Time Service Canada Centres. Visualizing all of these locations on a static map can become cluttered and unorganized. **SCIMA** takes full advantage of the modern, seamless interactive maps that can be developed using Mapbox services.

### Interactive features include:
* Geocoding
* Location-To-Location Routing (Car, Bike, Foot)
* Panning Capabilities
* Cluster Visualization
* Attribute Information

Refer to the [SCIMA Wiki](https://github.com/ktjaco/scima/wiki) for more information on interactive features!
